# Going Multi Cloud With MicroProfile and Jakarta EE

Open cloud-native Java is here to stay and so is MicroProfile & Jakarta EE. They are becoming popular options for people who want light-weight APIs for building and deploying cloud-native Java applications. This workshop will take you through the journey of creating a microservice using MicroProfile & Jakarta EE APIs from scratch, combining it with other microservices, and containerising them. Then we will move onto how these APIs work in a Kubernetes environment, what to consider, before deploying them to clouds and demonstrating how these APIs can be used to create services that are always available and optimised in a cloud-native way.
